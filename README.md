# fastfood-restaurant

## Details
This was my final project for Object-oriented Programming class in Sophomore Year. 
The app is a simulation for a food ordering system that can be set up at the restaurant itself or through customer's devices.
This application was developed using Windows Form written in C#. 
I decided to employ a text file organization system instead of SQL management tools for my in-program database operations
to improve my understanding of how C# works. Most controls in the app were created programmatically.
